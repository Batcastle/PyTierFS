# PyTierFS
Python-based Tiered storage network filesystem for home use. Provides built-in RAMDisk, arbitrary tiering, FTP and SMB access, RESTful API, and GUI web interface to configure.

    - Arbitrary tier count
        - Select drives to use, and let PyTierFS benchmark them and auto-tier them out
        - Keeps an index of all drives to aid in rapid searchs
        - The more a file is accessed, the higher up the tiers it is moved
        - Tiers numbered
            - lower=slower -> higher=faster
    - Graphical web interface via Flask
    - RESTful API
    - SMB support
    - FTP/FTPS support
    - Underlying FS can be anything
        - If BTRFS, utilizes BTRFS RAID, CoW, etc
        - If ZFS, utilizes built-in tiering, CoW, etc
        - NTFS: utilizes built-in indexing engine for searches
        - FAT32/exFAT: use for metadata only. Do not trust.
        - Anything else, it has a built-in fall back interface to use.
    - Saves metadata to disk before shutdown to reduce start-up load
        - Uses FAT32/exFAT drive if available thanks to their high IOPS speed
        - If FAT32/exFAT drive is not available, will store in highest, non-volatile tier
        - If Metadata is not available, it will be regenerated on the fly
    - Compiled for better speed and portability with Nuitka
        - Some parts will be written in Rust
    - Uses advanced memory management to reduce memory overhead
    - OOP-based design
    - Dynamically Multi-threaded
        - Users can configure if a given tier has a whole process, or a syncronus thread unto itself
        - RAM Disk gets a whole process by default, as does the core of PyTierFS
        - API and GUI web interface both get syncronus threads due to high wait times involved.
